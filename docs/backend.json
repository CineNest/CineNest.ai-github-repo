The `/users/{userId}` collection will store user profiles. This structure ensures that only the authenticated user (identified by `request.auth.uid`) can access their own data, simplifying security rules and maintaining data privacy.  This design achieves Authorization Independence because each user's data is self-contained under their own user ID, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to parent documents for authorization. The single `users` collection ensures a homogeneous security posture, simplifying rules. The QAP (Rules are not Filters) requirement is satisfied as the rules will be path-based, filtering by `request.auth.uid`, thus preventing listing unauthorized data."
